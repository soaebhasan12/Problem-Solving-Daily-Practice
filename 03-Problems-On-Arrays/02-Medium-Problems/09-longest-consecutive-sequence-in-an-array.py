# Longest Consecutive Sequence in an Array

"""
Given an array nums of n integers.

Return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers. The integers in this sequence can appear in any order.

Example 1
Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4

Explanation:
The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], which has a length of 4. This sequence can be formed regardless of the initial order of the elements in the array.


Example 2
Input: nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]
Output: 9

Explanation:
The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], which has a length of 9.

# BRUTE FORCE APPROACH


# OPTIMAL FORCE
nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]
setNums = set(nums)

longest = 0

for x in setNums:
    if (x-1) not in setNums:   # start of sequence
        current = x
        count = 1
        
        while (current+1) in setNums:
            current += 1
            count += 1
        
        longest = max(longest, count)

print(longest)



# BETTER APPROACH
nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]

nums.sort()

longest = 1
count = 1

if not nums:
    print(0)

for i in range(1, len(nums)):
  if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
    continue
  elif nums[i] == nums[i-1] + 1:
    count += 1
  else:
    count = 1
  
  longest = max(longest, count)

print(longest)
